# CS 250 Final Project: Sprint Review and Retrospective
## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
I interpret user needs and implement them into a program using a series of steps that require a combination of technical skills, empathy, and effective communication. I gather feedback, analyze the feedback for key features that users want, and prioritize the most important features to implement.
## How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are brief descriptions that define what the user wants and why they want it. User stories keep the team focused on the outcome of the product. User stories also encourage and increase collaboration between developers.
## How do I approach developing programs? 
I approach developing programs using agile methodologies, like iterative development and continuous feedback. I also break the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
## What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I hope to incorporate Scrum into my work. With Scrum, I can organize the work into Sprints and prioritize project tasks.
## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means collaborating effectively, sharing your ideas, and supporting your teammates in achieving your goals. It also means open communication with your teammates and ensuring that they understand project objectives and their responsibilities.
